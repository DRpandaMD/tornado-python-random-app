Tornado based Python App Written with ChatGPT

This is a project I had done while studying for one of my GCP Exams.  I had totally forgotten about it until I found it still hosted in Google Cloud Run!

As the name suggests, this is a Tornado Python App that I built with the Help of ChatGPT.

Almost every file in here has some type of input from ChatGPT.


Curious?  You can try the app here: https://myapp-tj4p6ap2ta-uc.a.run.app/
